# StringArt

A project for a BWINF Wintercamp. (This fork was created from someone in this Camp)
the fork adds the ability to create rgb solutions

As seen in [this](https://youtube.com/watch?v=WGccIFf6MF8&feature=share8) video this project gives a framework to convert images to a series of threading operations that result in a (hopefully) beautiful artwork.

Also have a look at [this repo](https://github.com/bdring/StringArt/) where you can find different implementations as well as instructions how to actually build such a device.

Have a look at Aufgaben.md
